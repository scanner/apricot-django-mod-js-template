A Django Project template based on the example project: [django-and-modular-js](http://integricho.github.io/2013/04/10/django-and-modular-js/)

This is for django projects that are primarily js client app driven with the javascript and css being broken up in a module fashion between various apps. RequireJS is used to make sure all the right pages get the right stuff.

This is also investigating the philosophy that the content templates are primarily being handled by the javascript code, not the django templating engine.

The django templating engine is still used but mostly for meta information holding the structure of the templates.

Well, we shall see. This is an experiment based on a combination of other peolples' ideas to suit the way I want to do things.
